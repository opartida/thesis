State-of-the-art

Current analysis of anomalies in flavour physics are based on a linear regression of a χ2 function. After taking into account correlation between
theoretical predictions and experimental observables, a χ2 function is built
and minimized.
Currently, 180 observables are considered from different collaborations [4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11]. Observable is referred to a measurement of either an angular observable, a branching ratio, or a ratio, in a particular energy bin. For
B → Kµµ, the available energy of the µµ invariant mass (the so called q 2
variable), runs from 0 to (mB − mK )2 ∼ 22GeV2 while for the B → K ∗ µµ
runs from 0 to (mB −mK∗ )2 ∼ 19GeV2 . In this exercise, charged and neutral
modes of the B meson are considered. This brings, B 0,± → K 0,± which are
equivalent up to isospin corrections, thus important to include all of them
for enlarging the data set. We also count with two different leptonic final
states, µµ and e + e−. Rations of the same observable but with different
lepton at the final state, the so-called R ratios, are also included and play an
important psychological goal since they are a clear indication of the Lepton
Flavor Universality Violation - LFUV - (this is, that the Z and W bosons
of the SM interact differently with electrons and muons, something which
is not expected from the theory) [3]. On the contrary, deviations between
theory and experiment for specific lepton, either muons or electrons, cannot distinguish whether the anomaly is due to LFUV phenomenon or new
physics come universally for muons and electrons. Only the combination of
lepton-flavor dependent and rations of observables with different leptons in
the final state may help. But actually, there is no clean way to disentangle
such situation and current attempts consider that the most appealing solution to the puzzle is indeed having two different new physics scenarios, two
different new-physics particles, one affecting all lepton flavours and a second
one affecting exclusively the muonic modes [2].

For a given decay process, for example, the branching ratio B 0 → K ∗0 µµ
we will have five or six energy bins, with each bin having 1 or 2 GeV2 sizes,
thus providing 5 of 6 so-called observables into the fit.
For each measured observable, we have a theory prediction based on the
Standard Model of Particle Physics (SM). With 180 observables, the χ2 value
of the SM reaches 225 points [1], which corresponds to a p-value of 1.4%.
This indicates the SM to be very far to explain experimental measurements.
The strategy then has been to include on top of the SM, new operators
in the effective Hamiltonian to be able to account for such experimental
discrepancies.
Standard strategy, the simplest one, considers one-single operator at a
time, the so-called 1D fits, starting with C7 , C9 and C10 . For example, in
Table 1, some examples can be found from Ref. [1]. The first one, a fit with
NP returns C NP = −0.98. The C SM ∼ 4, so the NP correction to the SM to
C9µ

9µ
explain these anomalies are around 25%, pretty large. PullSM reflects how
NP ) would be able to
difficult would be for that model (defined as SM + C9µ
explain the SM. The p-value is then a criterion to decide whether this fit is
rejected or not. Since p-values are very large, the fit is very good compared
to the SM p-value of 1.4%.

Aim of this project

Use a neural network to determine what combination of new operators renders the best possible fit to experimental data.
The intuition can be obtained by looking at the tables of Ref. [1], one of
them reproduced here. Forget by now about coefficients with a prime such
as C90 or C100 . The difference between C9V and C9U is that V refers to muon

channel exclusively while U means both muons and electrons. In the long
table, different ad-hoc combinations of wilson coefficients are considered.
There are, of course, other options. The question is what is the particular
combnation that renders the largest agreement with data without using
all coeficients free. This is, instead of using, for example 4 parameters
V , C U , what combination of two parameters (made from the
C9V , C9U and C10
10
V ) yields the
combination of these four, for example C9V = ±C9U , C9V = ±C10
best agreement.
The goal is then try to look for these combination via exploring the many
options using a neural network. The input shall be a fit with one single
parameter at the begining, and explore different χ2 values using different
input coefficients for each observable and then let the neural network decide
the best strategy. Combining 2D fits, with two different combinations of
coeficients, arbitrary cobination, also provides information for the NN to
learn, and it is proved that this is most eficient.

Trining exercise

Before starting with full fits with 180 observables, we shall explore the mechanics with a just few of them that can be easily parameterized as a polynomial. The example considers the hP50 i observable, the most famous one,
in different bins. I run my codes to generate a polynomial description for
this observable. In the table, experimental results and SM predictions for
the observable are collected.
We will use the following parameterization for the observables.
2
hP50 i[0.1,0.98] = 0.674 − 0.060C10 − 0.012C10
− 0.104C9 − 0.010C9 C10 + 0.005C92
2
hP50 i[1.1,2.5] = 0.196 − 0.001C10 − 0.004C10
− 0.210C9 + 0.001C9 C10 + 0.002C92
2
hP50 i[2.5,4] = −0.491 − 0.042C10 + 0.001C10
− 0.285C9 − 0.020C9 C10 + 0.033C92
2
hP50 i[4,6] = −0.826 − 0.066C10 + 0.004C10
− 0.207C9 + 0.011C9 C10 + 0.058C92
2
hP50 i[6,8] = −0.937 − 0.060C10 + 0.009C10
− 0.131C9 + 0.036C9 C10 + 0.055C92
2
hP50 i[15,19] = −0.572 − 0.021C10 + 0.010C10
− 0.040C9 + 0.029C9 C10 + 0.025C92

Notice that for C9 = C10 = 0, we recover the SM prediction.
Imagine, you solve hP50 i[0.1,0.98] = 0.52 ± 0.10 but using only C9 , you get
C9 = 1.58. However, if you take hP50 i[4,6] = −0.83 ± 0.08, you get C9 = −1.32
which has nothing to do. A combined fit to all these observables returns

Table 2: Most prominent patterns for LFU and LFUV NP contributions
from Fit “All”. Scenarios 5 to 8 were introduced in Ref. [2]. Scenarios 9
(motivated by 2HDMs [13]) and 10 to 13 (motivated by Z 0 models with
vector-like quarks [14]) are newly introduced in the main text.

C9 = −1.06 with χ2min = 9.2, which is not really a good fit. Moreover, if
we neglect the last bin, the fit returns C9 = −1.24 with χ2min = 4.0, much
better. The question is then, what observable weights more in the fit and
how can be put into agreement the different tensions.
Figure 1 represents the final philosophy. Each observable (yellow circle)
has an experimental value (xi ) depending on the bin you are looking at. For
hP50 i we have 6 different bins, so we will have 6 different xi . Each of it can
include C9 , C10 , with V, U , and all these options are represented with yi . The
combination of observable in a particular bin, with a fit with a C coefficient,
returns a χ2 value.
The NN should learn how to reach the best χ2 by exploring all the
possible combinations of C wilson coefficients with the experimental values

Two different strategies to be compared:
• look for the minimum χ2
• look for the solution with closer χ2 /dof = 1 possible.
